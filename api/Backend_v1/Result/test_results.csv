A: Yes

Q: Can cucumbers grow without insects?
A:",Yes,"Q: Is growing seedless cucumber good for a gardener with entomophobia?
A: Yes

Q: Can cucubmers grow without insects?
A:",increase,,"Cucumbers can be grown without insects, as they are typically pollinated by bees and other non-insect means, such as wind or self-pollination.","No.

(Note: I corrected the typo in your question, it's ""cucumbers"", not ""cucubmers"")",-0.09162016212940216,0.23041942715644836,True

A: Yes

Q: Can cucumbers grow without insects?
A:",Yes,"Q: Is growing seedless cucumber good for a gardener with entomophobia?
A: Yes

Q: Can cucumbers grow without insects ?
A:",increase,,"Cucumbers typically require pollination, which is often facilitated by insects such as bees and butterflies. However, some breeds of cucumbers are bred to be insect-repellent or self-pollinating, reducing the need for external pollinators. As a result, growing seedless cucumber may reduce the likelihood of encountering insects in the garden, making it a potentially more comfortable option for someone with entomophobia.","Here's a logical sentence:

Cucumbers can be grown in an environment with minimal insect presence, but it is unlikely that they will completely thrive without any insects at all.",-0.08601536601781845,-0.06976453214883804,True
